# Day 8: Resonant Collinearity

## Part 1

The input is a map of antennas with frequencies, filling empty space with periods. A character in the input represents the antenna position and its frequency in an alphanumeric range (case sensitive).

Antennas generate antinodes over a shared frequency. An antinode position is in line with two matching antennas and has one antenna twice as far away as the other. Antinodes are allowed to overlay other antennas. Antinodes generated outside the map bounds are ignored. Example with `#` as antinodes generated by two antennas:

```
..........
...#......
..........
....a.....
..........
.....a....
..........
......#...
..........
..........
```

The solution should find the number of unique antinode locations within the bounds of the input map.

## Part 2

The calculation for antinodes is expanded to have repetition. Instead of just one antenna distance, antinodes occur along every multiple of the distance and includes the antenna locations. Example of 9 antinodes with this modified calculation:

```
T....#....
...T......
.T....#...
.........#
..#.......
..........
...#......
..........
....#.....
..........
```

Resolve the sum of unique antinode locations with this new antinode calculation.
