## Part 1

The input is a collection of available stripe color patterns for towels then a list of desired pattern designs.

The available stripe colors are white (w), blue (u), black (b), red (r), and green (g). A stripe pattern cannot be reversed.

A pattern design is a sequence of stripe colors. It's desired that the design can be reproduced by arranging many towels together, but is not guaranteed.

The solution must determine the number of designs possible from the list.

## Part 2

The solution must now determine the number of unique towel arrangements for a design then sum them across all possible designs.
